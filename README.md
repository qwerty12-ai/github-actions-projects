# github-actions-projects
This is a repo i used to implement github actions on github hosted and self hosted runners to further my knowledge i had from learning jenkins conceptually and with a jenkins + docker agent tutorial.

- **Using public repo gives free access to github actions and private repo allows some hours of time to github actions in ci/cd pipeline duration**
- **Jenkins good when complex pipelines exist with private repo or only source-code managed repos**
- **Github actions when user-friendly simple to moderate pipelines used in open-source repos**
